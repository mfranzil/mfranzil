# Hi there â›°

I'm Matteo Franzil, a Master's Student in Computer Science currently based in Trento, Italy. I plan to finish my studies in October 2022 and begin working afterwards.

Feel free to tinker with my repositories, fork them or make pull requests.

I have a work portfolio at [matteo.franzil.com](https://matteo.franzil.com/) and a photography portofolio at [FranzilMedia](https://www.franzilmedia.com/matteo-franzil/). You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matteo-franzil-20823414b/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/qwilava), and [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/qwilava).

## University of Trento 

As of 2021-10-08, most of my [University of Trento](https://www.disi.unitn.it/) material has been moved to its [organization](https://github.com/mfranzil-unitn/). It is clearly marked as `unitn-*`. Other are personal or side projects.
