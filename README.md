### Hi there ⛰

I'm Matteo Franzil, a Master's Student in Computer Science currently based in Trento, Italy. I plan to finish my studies in 2022 and begin working afterwards.

Feel free to tinker with my repositories, fork them or make pull requests. Most of them contain materials for some University of Trento courses (and are clearly marked as `unitn-*`). Other are personal or side projects.

I have a work portfolio at [matteo.franzil.com](https://matteo.franzil.com/) and a photography portofolio at [FranzilMedia](https://www.franzilmedia.com/matteo-franzil/). You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matteo-franzil-20823414b/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/qwilava), and [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/qwilava).
