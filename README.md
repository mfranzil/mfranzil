# Hi there â›°

I'm Matteo Franzil, from Sassari, Italy and based in Trento, Italy.

I am a PhD student at the [University of Trento](https://www.disi.unitn.it/), with a grant sponsored by [Fondazione Bruno Kessler](https://www.fbk.eu/) ([DAISY](https://daisy.fbk.eu) unit, Center for Cybersecurity). I perform research on containerization, cloud computing, distributed systems, network protocols and algorithms.

As of A.Y. 2025-2026, I have teaching duties at the University of Trento for the following courses: Databases, Operating Systems, and Fog and Cloud Computing. If you are looking for my teaching material, you can find it in the [rising-unitn](https://github.com/rising-unitn) organization:

- The Operating Systems code is [here](https://github.com/rising-unitn/os-lab-2025).
- The Fog and Cloud Computing code is [here](https://github.com/rising-unitn/fcc-lab-2025).
- The Databases code is [here](https://github.com/rising-unitn/db-lab-2025).

Feel free to tinker with my repositories, fork them or make pull requests.
