# Hi there â›°

I'm Matteo Franzil, a Master's Student in Computer Science currently based in Trento, Italy. I plan to finish my studies in October 2022 and begin working afterwards.

I have a work portfolio at [matteo.franzil.com](https://matteo.franzil.com/) and a photography portofolio at [FranzilMedia](https://www.franzilmedia.com/matteo-franzil/).
