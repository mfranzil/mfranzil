# Hi there â›°

I'm Matteo Franzil, from Sassari, Italy and based in Trento, Italy.

At the moment, I am working:
- as a Researcher for [Fondazione Bruno Kessler](https://www.fbk.eu/), within the [Robust and Secure Distributed Computing](https://rising.fbk.eu) unit (RiSING), Center for Cybersecurity. I perform research on containerization, cloud computing, distributed systems, network protocols and algorithms;
- as a Teaching Assistant for the [University of Trento](https://www.disi.unitn.it/), with guest teaching duties and/or exam management for the Probability, Programming 1, and Fog and Cloud Computing courses.
